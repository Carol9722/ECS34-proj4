# ECS34-proj4
For our Dijstras algorithm, we got help from https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dijkstras-shortest-path-algorithm-using-priority_queue-stl/

to help us understand how priority queue is used to implement a shortest path algorithm

We also used https://www.programiz.com/dsa/dijkstra-algorithm to understand how the dijkstra algorithm works with examples.
